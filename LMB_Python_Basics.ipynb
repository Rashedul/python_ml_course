Note that there are comments, from the `#` symbol onwards, which is only for a human to read and will not be interpreted as Python. Each labeled item, which is more correctly called a *variable*, is a way of attaching a name to a piece of data, and as the term suggests the actual value that is being referred to can change while the remainder of the program remains the same, i.e. we could calculate the density in the same way for different masses and volumes.
