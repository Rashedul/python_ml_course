    "## What is machine learning?\n",
    "Fundamentally, machine learning involves building mathematical models that help understand data. The learning component arises from the way models have tunable parameters that can be adjusted to fit to some training data. Ideally, once these models have been fit to previously seen training data, they are able to predict some aspect of newly observed data.\n",

    "### Clustering - Inferring labels on unlabeled data\n",
    "One common case of unsupervised learning is clustering. Here data is automatically assigned to some number of discrete groups. For example, we might have some two-dimensional data like that shown in the following figure:\n",

    "<BR CLEAR=\"left\">\n",
    "\n",
    "By eye, it is very clear that the points belong to three distinct and separate classes. Given the input of points, a clustering algorithm will use the intrinsic structure of the data to determine which points are related to each other. An example algorithm for this is [k-means clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means).\n",

    "### Dimensionality reduction and manifold learning - Inferring structure on unlabeled data\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is another example of unsupervised learning. However, unlike clustering, dimensionality reduction attempts to extract a lower dimensional representation of the data whilst preserving the relevant qualities of the full dataset. In the following examples, we can see how different dimensionality reduction algorithms transform 3d data into a 2d representation.\n",

    "### Classification - Predicting discrete labels\n",
    "Classification algorithms are supervised learning methods that aim to group unseen data into some set number of labels. In this example, we have two-dimensional data. That is, we have two features for each point, represented by the (x,y) positions of the points on the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we have one of two class labels for each point - represented by the colors of the points. From these features and labels, we would like to create a model that will let us decide whether a new point should be labeled \"blue\" or \"red.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many classification algorithms available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, but in this example, we will use a very simple linear classifier to separate the points. To do so, we will make the assumption that the two groups can be separated by drawing a straight line through the plane between them, such that points on each side of the line fall in the same group. The optimal values for these model parameters are learned from the data (this is the \"learning\" in machine learning), which is often called training the model.\n",

    "<BR CLEAR=\"left\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic idea of a classification task in machine learning, where \"classification\" indicates that the data has known and discrete class labels. In the above example, this may look fairly trivial. However, most real datasets are significantly more complex, due to the size of the dataset and number of extra dimensions. For example, a protein sequence of length 100 has 2,000 dimensions. That being said, the advantage of the more advanced machine learning algorithms are that they are able to handle such sizes and dimensionality, whilst generalising to unseen data.\n",
